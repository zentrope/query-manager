# TO DO

Just random stuff I may or may not want to do, or that may or may not
be a good idea.

## Simple Stuff

- [ ] fix web.clj go-blocks to be simpler
- [ ] fix jobs to be core.async
- [ ] move jobs to state
- [ ] move repo to state
- [ ] merge with master

## Complex Stuff

- [ ] persist jobs to local disk cache
- [ ] persist queries to local disk cache
- [ ] provide facility to zip up cache for transport
- [ ] all state should be in an "instance" var in main
